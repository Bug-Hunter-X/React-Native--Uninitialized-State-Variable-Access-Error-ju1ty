This error occurs when you try to access a state variable before it has been initialized.  This often happens in functional components before the first render.  It results in a `undefined is not an object` error if you attempt to access a property of that undefined variable.

```javascript
//Buggy Code
import React, {useState} from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{count.someProperty}</Text> {/* Error here */}
      <Button title="Increment" onPress={() => setCount(count + 1)} />
    </View>
  );
};


export default MyComponent;
```
